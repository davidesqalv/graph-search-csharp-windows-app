# Graph Search Windows App in C#
Made with Visual Studio C# a long time ago (around 2015)

Windows Forms app that allows to perform Breadth First Search and Depth First Search on a graph the user inputs

Nodes (vertice.cs) are linked list objects, and Graphs are declared also as an object with all the functions contained within (because C# = OOP)

Main code is in Form1.cs, because of how windows apps work in visual studio

Nodes and then connections are inserted. Just click on the selection button to get the list of nodes in either search algorithm
